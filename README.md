<!-- ABOUT -->

## About The Project

I’m excited about how much I’ve learned so far. In this README, I’m not just here to drop the technical deets but also to share my experiences, tips, and maybe even a few corgi memes (if you’re lucky). So if you’re also on this Nix journey, I hope my ramblings and discoveries help guide you along the way!

This is very much a work in progress—because let’s be honest, nothing is ever truly finished, there’s always something to tweak or improve.

I’m pretty excited about how much I've to learn, and I can’t wait to dive even deeper.

With this project, I want to share not just the technical details, but also my journey, hoping to help fellow explorers of the Nix world.

## Why Corgix?

I just wanted to name this project, and wanted to be a funny name. I like Corgis, Neovim, and Nix... so naturally, Corgix was the only choice obviously. Also, _~~I don't know how to name things~~_.
